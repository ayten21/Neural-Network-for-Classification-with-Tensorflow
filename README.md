# Neural-Network-for-Classification-with-Tensorflow
In this notebook I have tried to explain how to approach a classification task in the Neural Network with TensorFlow. I've created 3 models in the first way that came to mind, and with the help of visualization we realized where we were wrong, we explored linearity, non-linearity, and finally, we managed to build a generalized model. What I was trying to show with all these codes and the steps I was following was that nothing is 100 percent accurate or fixed, everything continues to change every day. To guess which problem you are likely to face in which kind of data and to see which combinations lead to a better result, all you need is to write a lot more code and gain experience. So write this code down yourself while reading, also to get more detailed information about the code and steps, check this link out and read my article: https://www.analyticsvidhya.com/blog/2021/11/neural-network-for-classification-with-tensorflow/
